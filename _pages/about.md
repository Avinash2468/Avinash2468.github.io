Hello! I am Avinash Prabhu. I'm a currently 1st year MS in CS student at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning. I graduated from [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) in July 2022, with a BTech (Honors) in ECE.

At IIIT, I was an undergraduate researcher at [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), advised by [Dr. Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&hl=en). Here, I worked on the 3D reconstruction of scenes from a single image using Deep Learning based Computer Vision. I also worked at the [Precog Lab](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) under [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfzQyP8AAAAJ&hl=en). Here, I worked on understanding the behaviour of users on Twitter using ML models. 

Broadly, I am interested and specialise in **Deep/Machine Learning** techniques. I love to design and train models, deal with large and complex datasets, ultimately designing an AI system that I am proud of. My specific subfield of interest in **Computer Vision**. I am deeply passionate about this field and enjoy reading and replicating results of top research papers, as well as designing my own CNN networks. I strongly believe synthetic data is the key to solving several problems in Computer Vision.

Apart from my academics and research, I love to swim and play tennis.
