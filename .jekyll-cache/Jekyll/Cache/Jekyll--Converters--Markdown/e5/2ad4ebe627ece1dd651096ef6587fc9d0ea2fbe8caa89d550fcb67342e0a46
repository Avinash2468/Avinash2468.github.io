I"	<p>Hello! I am Avinash Prabhu. Iâ€™m a currently 1st year MS in CS student at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT-Hyderabad</a> in July 2022, with a BTech (Honors) in ECE.</p>

<p>At IIIT, I was an undergraduate researcher at <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">Robotics Research Center</a>, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Madhava Krishna</a>. Here, I worked on the 3D reconstruction of scenes from a single image using Deep Learning based Computer Vision. I also worked at the <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/">Precog Lab</a> under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfzQyP8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</a>. Here, I worked on understanding the behaviour of users on Twitter using ML models.</p>

<p>Broadly, I am interested and specialise in <strong>Deep/Machine Learning</strong> techniques. I love to design and train models, deal with large and complex datasets, ultimately designing an AI system that I am proud of. My specific subfield of interest in <strong>Computer Vision</strong>. I am deeply passionate about this field and enjoy reading and replicating results of top research papers, as well as designing my own CNN networks. I strongly believe synthetic data is the key to solving several problems in Computer Vision.</p>

<p>Apart from my academics and research, I love to swim and play tennis.</p>
